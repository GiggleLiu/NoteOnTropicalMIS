abstract = {The maximum clique problem (MCP) is to determine in a graph a clique (i.e., a complete subgraph) of maximum cardinality. The MCP is notable for its capability of modeling other combinatorial problems and real-world applications. As one of the most studied NP-hard problems, many algorithms are available in the literature and new methods are continually being proposed. Given that the two existing surveys on the MCP date back to 1994 and 1999 respectively, one primary goal of this paper is to provide an updated and comprehensive review on both exact and heuristic MCP algorithms, with a special focus on recent developments. To be informative, we identify the general framework followed by these algorithms and pinpoint the key ingredients that make them successful. By classifying the main search strategies and putting forward the critical elements of the most relevant clique methods, this review intends to encourage future development of more powerful methods and motivate new applications of the clique approaches.}

title = {Maximum Independent Set and Related Problems, with Applications},
year = {2003},
publisher = {University of Florida},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This dissertation develops novel approaches to solving computationally difficult combinatorial
optimization problems on graphs, namely maximum independent set, maximum clique, graph
coloring, minimum dominating sets and related problems. The application areas of the
considered problems include information retrieval, classification theory, economics,
scheduling, experimental design, and computer vision among many others. The maximum
independent set and related problems are formulated as nonlinear programs, and new
methods for finding good quality approximate solutions in reasonable computational
times are introduced. All algorithms are implemented and successfully tested on a
number of examples from diverse application areas. The proposed methods favorably
compare with other competing approaches. A large part of this dissertation is devoted
to detailed studies of selected applications of the problems of interest. Novel techniques
for analyzing the structure of financial markets based on their network representation
are proposed and verified using massive data sets generated by the U.S. stock markets.
The network representation of a market is based on cross-correlations of price fluctuations
of the financial instruments, and provides a valuable tool for classifying the instruments.
In another application, new exact values and estimates of size of the largest error
correcting codes are computed using optimization in specially constructed graphs.
Error correcting codes lie in the heart of digital technology, making cell phones,
compact disk players and modems possible. They are also of a special significance
due to increasing importance of reliability issues in Internet transmissions. Finally,
efficient approximate algorithms for construction of virtual backbone in wireless
networks by means of solving the minimum connected dominating set problem in unit-disk
graphs are developed and tested.},

In this paper we improve Prisner's upper bound on the number of maximal bicliques (Combinatorica, 20, 109--117, 2000) and show that the maximum number of maximal bicliques in a graph on n vertices is Θ(3n/3). Our major contribution is an exact exponential-time algorithm. This branching algorithm computes the number of distinct maximal independent sets in a graph in time O(1.3642n), where n is the number of vertices of the input graph. We use this counting algorithm and previously known algorithms for various other problems related to independent sets to derive algorithms for problems related to bicliques via polynomial-time reductions.},

To achieve this result, we modify the classic Bron--Kerbosch algorithm and show that it runs in time O(dn3d/3). We also provide matching upper and lower bounds showing that the largest possible number of maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph with degeneracy d (when d is a multiple of 3 and n{\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}d{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}3) is (n{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}d)3d/3. Therefore, our algorithm matches the $\Theta$(d(n{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}d)3d/3) worst-case output size of the problem whenever n{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}d{\thinspace}={\thinspace}$\Omega$(n).",
