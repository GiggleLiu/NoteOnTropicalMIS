\begin{abstract}
We introduce a new approach to compute various properties of independent sets by encoding the problems and the graph into tensor networks with different tensor element algebra.
The type of graph problems that can be computed using this method includes: independence number, the number of independent sets, independence polynomial, maximal independence polynomial, and both counting and enumeration of all maximum independence sets, the large-size independent sets, and all maximal independent sets.
Although the computational complexity inevitably scales exponentially with the graph size, our method using tensor network contraction with generic programming is highly versatile and is able to compute properties that are otherwise not known to be possible for up to several hundred vertices.
At the same time, our algorithms are very simple to implement and one can directly utilize recent advances in tensor network contraction techniques.
To demonstrate the versatility of this tool, we apply it to a few examples including the calculations of the hard-square entropy constant, Euler characteristics of the independence complex, partition functions, and finite-temperature phase transitions on square-lattice graphs.

\section{Introduction}
\blue{overlap gap property~\cite{Gamarnik2013, Gamarnik2019}, independence polynomial at -1~\cite{Bousquet2008,Levit2009},
branching algorithm~\cite{Tarjan1977,Robson1986},
two motivations of computing independence polynomial: 1. Lee-Yang zero~\cite{Lee1952,Yang1952}, 2. Lov{\'a}sz local lemma~\cite{Scott2005}.
}
In graph theory and combinatorics, there are many interesting but hard computational problems concerning properties of independent sets.
An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph where no two vertices are adjacent to each other.
More formally, given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$, an independent set $I \subseteq V$ is a set that for any $u,v \in I$, there is no edge connecting $u$ and $v$ in $G$.
The problem of finding an independent set of the largest possible size, the maximum independent set (MIS), is a paradigmatic NP-complete problem~\cite{Hastad1996}.
The size of the MIS of a graph $G$ is called the independence number, denoted as $\alpha(G) \equiv \max_{I}|I|$. 

Finding $\alpha(G)$ is a hard computational problem; moreover, it is NP-hard to even approximate $\alpha(G)$ within a factor $|V|^{1-\epsilon}$ for an arbitrarily small positive $\epsilon$.
Naive exhaustive search for the MIS requires time $O\left(2^{|V|} \right)$. More efficient exact algorithms include the branching algorithms and dynamic programming.
Sophisticated branching algorithms can reduce the base of the exponential time scaling to, e.g., $1.1996^{|V|} {|V|}^{O(1)}$~\cite{Xiao2017}.
Dynamic programming approaches~\cite{Courcelle1990, Fomin2013} works better for graphs with a small treewidth $\text{tw}(G)$;
these methods can produce algorithms of complexity $O(2^{\text{tw}(G)} \text{tw}(G) |V|)$.

The independent set problem is closely related to the clique problem and the vertex cover problem~\cite{Moore2011};
more concretely, an MIS of a graph $G$ corresponds to a maximum clique in the complement graph of $G$,
and the complement vertex set of an MIS corresponds to a minimum vertex cover of the graph $G$.
Together, these problems find a wide range of applications in scheduling, logistics, social network analysis, bioinformatics, wireless networks and telecommunication,
map labelling, computer vision, etc.~\cite{Butenko2003, Wu2015}.
Besides the standard problem of finding the independence number and an MIS, there are many other interesting problems pertaining to independent sets, such as the number of independent sets,
independence polynomial, maximal independence polynomial, and enumeration of MIS or maximal independent set configurations.
Some of these problems are of great interest in physics applications such as the hard-core lattice gas model~\cite{Dyre2016, Fernandes2007}
in statistical mechanics and the Rydberg hamiltonian with neutral atoms~\cite{Pichler2018} \red{cite experiment when it's ready};
they can, for example, be used to understand phase transitions and to identify harder graphs in an ensemble of graphs \red{cite experiment}.

In this work, we introduce a tensor-network based framework to compute the various properties pertaining to independent sets.
We map different problems into generic tensor network contraction with various tensor element algebra.
Our approach does not necessarily provide a better time complexity compared to dynamic programming,
but the tensor network approach is highly versatile so different problems can be generically solved with minimal implementation efforts without loss of efficiency.
We benchmark our algorithms by computing various independent set properties on CPUs and GPUs, the implementation of which benefits from recent advances in tensor-network contraction for the purposes of quantum circuit simulations~\cite{Gray2021, Pan2021}.
Lastly, we provide a few examples and show that the toolbox can be used to calculate the hard-square entropy constant,
Euler characteristics of the independence complex, partition functions, and finite-temperature phase transitions on square-lattice graphs. 

\section{Tensor networks}
A tensor network~\cite{Cirac2020, Orus2014} can be viewed as a generalization of matrix multiplication to multi-dimensional tensor contraction.
Let $A, B$ be two matrices; the matrix multiplication is defined as $C_{ik} = \sum_{j}A_{ij}B_{jk}$.
Using the Einstein notation, we can write $C_{ik} = A_{ij}B_{jk}$, where $j$ is implicitly summed over.
In the standard notation, each index can appear at most twice. A tensor network consists of multiple tensors performing the sum-product operation,
i.e., contraction, and the tensor network can be represented as a multigraph with open edges by viewing a tensor as a vertex,
a label pairing two tensors as an edge, and the remaining unpaired labels as open edges.

\begin{example}
   A tensor network $C_{il} = A_{ijkm} B_{kml} V_{j}$ has the following multigraph representation.
   
\centerline{\begin{tikzpicture}[
    dot/.style = {circle, fill, minimum size=#1,
                inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt},
    dot/.default = 6pt  % size of the circle diameter 
                    ]
    \def\dx{0};
    \def\r{0.25cm}
    \def\ax{0}
    \def\ay{0}
    \def\bx{1}
    \def\by{1}
    \def\cx{1}
    \def\cy{-1}
    \node[color=white, fill=black, dot=2*\r] at (\ax+\dx,\ax) (a) {A};
    \node[color=white, fill=black, dot=2*\r] at (\bx+\dx,\by) (b) {B};
    \node[color=white, fill=black, dot=2*\r] at (\cx+\dx,\cy) (c) {V};
    %\draw [black,thick] (\ax+\dx,\ay) .. controls (0.5*\ax+0.5*\bx+\dx+0.2,0.5*\ay+0.5*\by-0.2) .. (\bx+\dx,\by);
    %\draw [black,thick] (\ax+\dx,\ay) .. controls (0.5*\ax+0.5*\bx+\dx-0.2,0.5*\ay+0.5*\by+0.2) .. (\bx+\dx,\by);
    \draw [black,thick] (a) .. controls (0.4, 0.6) .. (b);
    \draw [black,thick] (a) .. controls (0.6, 0.4) .. (b);
    \draw [black,thick] (a) -- (c);
    \draw [black,thick] (a) -- (\ax+\dx-0.8,\ay);
    \draw [black,thick] (b) -- (\bx+\dx+0.8,\by);
    \node[color=black] at (0.5*\ax+0.5*\bx-0.3+\dx,0.5*\ay+0.5\by+0.3) {k};
    \node[color=black] at (0.5*\ax+0.5*\bx+0.3+\dx,0.5*\ay+0.5\by-0.3) {m};
    \node[color=black] at (0.5*\ax+0.5*\cx+\dx+0.2,0.5*\ay+0.5\cy+0.2) {j};
    \node[color=black] at (\ax+\dx-0.5,\ay-0.2) {i};
    \node[color=black] at (\bx+\dx+0.5,\by-0.2) {l};
\end{tikzpicture}}
\end{example}

One can generalize the tensor network notation by removing the restriction that each index can appear at most twice.
The notation can be considered as a generalized Einstein notation, which is sometimes called einsum,
sum-product network or factor graph~\cite{Bishop2006} in different contexts.
The graphical representation of a tensor network we use in this paper is a hypergraph, where an edge (label) can be shared by an arbitrary number of vertices (tensors).

\begin{example}
$C_{ijk} = A_{jkm} B_{mil} V_{jm}$ is a tensor network representing $C_{ijk} = \sum_{ml}A_{jkm} B_{mil} V_{jm}$,
where $i,j,k$ in the output tensor are open edges.
Its hypergraph representation is shown below, where we use different colors to annotate different hyperedges and open circles to denote open edges.

\centerline{\begin{tikzpicture}[
    dot/.style = {circle, fill, minimum size=#1,
                inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt},
    dot/.default = 6pt  % size of the circle diameter 
                    ]  
    \def\dx{0};
    \def\r{0.5cm}
    \def\sr{0.15cm}
    \def\ax{0}
    \def\ay{0}
    \def\bx{1}
    \def\by{1}
    \def\cx{1}
    \def\cy{-1}
    \node[color=white,fill=black,dot=\r] at (\ax+\dx,\ax) (a) {A};
    \node[color=white,fill=black,dot=\r] at (\bx+\dx,\by) (b) {B};
    \node[color=white,fill=black,dot=\r] at (\cx+\dx,\cy) (v) {V};
    \node[color=transparent,draw=transparent,dot=0] at (\ax-1,\by) (o1) {};
    \node[color=transparent,draw=transparent,dot=0] at (\ax-1.5,\ay) (o2) {};
    \node[color=transparent,draw=transparent,dot=0] at (\ax-1,\cy) (o3) {};
    \node at (\ax-0.8,\ay) (k) {k};
    \node at (\bx+0.4,\ay) (m) {m};
    \node at (\ax,\cy) (j) {j};
    \node at (\bx+1,\by) (l) {l};
    \node at (\bx-1,\by) (i) {i};
    \draw[color=blue,thick] (i) -- (b);
    \draw[color=blue,thick] (i) -- (o1);
    \draw[color=cyan,thick] (l) -- (b);
    \draw[color=violet,thick] (k) -- (a);
    \draw[color=violet,thick] (k) -- (o2);
    \draw[color=black,thick] (b) -- (m);
    \draw[color=black,thick] (m) -- (a);
    \draw[color=black,thick] (m) -- (v);
    \draw[color=red,thick] (a) -- (j);
    \draw[color=red,thick] (v) -- (j);
    \draw[color=red,thick] (o3) -- (j);
\end{tikzpicture}}
\end{example}

In the main text, we use the generalized tensor network notation. The generalized tensor network can be easily translated to the standard notation by adding identity tensors denoted as $\delta$ tensors.
The example above can be written as $C_{ijk} = A_{jkm} B_{mil} V_{jm} = A_{ukm} B_{pil} V_{vq} \delta_{mpq} \delta_{juv}\delta_l$ in the standard notion. However, by adding the $\delta$ tensors, one may unnecessarily increase the contraction complexity of a graph, which we illustrate in \App{app:tensorbad}.

\section{Generic programming}\label{sec:generic}
In previous works combining tensor network and combinatoric problems~\cite{Kourtis2019,Biamonte2017},
the elements in tensor networks are limited to regular number types such as floating point numbers and integers.
As the development of modern compiling technology, we do not need to limit our imaginations to regular number types anymore.
The key technology playing the role is called the generic programming:

\begin{definition}[Generic programming]
   Generic programming is an approach to programming that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures so that they work in the most general setting without loss of efficiency. ~\cite{Stepanov2014}
\end{definition}

This definition of generic programming contains two major pieces, one is a single program for the general setting, and another is about efficiency.
To understand the first point, suppose we want to write a function to take the power of an element $f(x, n) := x^n$.
One can easily write a function for regular numbers that computes the power of $x$ in $\log(n)$ steps using the multiply and square trick.
A generic programmer does not assume $x$ being a regular number type,
instead it treats $x$ as an element with an associative multiplication operation $\odot$ and multiplicative identity $\mymathbb{1}$.
In such a way, when the program takes a matrix as input, it computes the matrix power without extra efforts.
The second point about performance. For dynamic typed languages like Python,
one can easily write very general codes, however, the efficiency is not guaranteed.
Imagine the speed of computing the matrix multiplication between two numpy arrays with python objects as elements.
The generic programming that we want to discuss is those in static types languages like C++, and Julia~\cite{Bezanson2012}.
C++ uses templates for generic programming while Julia has just in time compiling and multiple dispatch.
When they ``sees'' a new input type, the compiler recompiles the generic program for the new type.
A lot optimization can be done during the compiling, like inlining immutable elements with fixed sizes in an array to decrease the cache miss rate when accessing data.
In Julia, these inlined arrays can even be compiled to GPU devices for faster computation~\cite{Besard2018}.

This leads us to think about what is the most general element type that allowed in a tensor network contraction program.
Our finding is: as long as the algebra of tensor elements forms a commutative semiring, the tensor network contraction result is contraction order independent.
A commutative semiring is a semiring with its multiplication operation being commutative, while a semiring is a ring without additive inverse.
To define a commutative semiring with the addition operation $\oplus$ and the multiplication operation $\odot$ on a set $R$, the following relations must hold for arbitrary three elements $a, b, c \in R$.
\begin{align*}
(a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) & \hspace{5em}\text{$\triangleright$ commutative monoid $\oplus$ with identity $\mymathbb{0}$}\\
a \oplus \mymathbb{0} = \mymathbb{0} \oplus a = a &\\
a \oplus b = b \oplus a &\\
&\\
(a \odot b) \odot c = a \odot (b \odot c)  &   \hspace{5em}\text{$\triangleright$ commutative monoid $\odot$ with identity $\mymathbb{1}$}\\
a \odot  \mymathbb{1} =  \mymathbb{1} \odot a = a &\\
a \odot b = b \odot a &\\
&\\
a \odot (b\oplus c) = a\odot b \oplus a\odot c  &  \hspace{5em}\text{$\triangleright$ left and right distributive}\\
(a\oplus b) \odot c = a\odot c \oplus b\odot c &\\
&\\
a \odot \mymathbb{0} = \mymathbb{0} \odot a = \mymathbb{0}
\end{align*}
The requirement of being commutative is for the tensor contraction result to be independent of the contraction order, which could be relaxed in certain cases. In the following sections, we show how to compute the independence polynomial,
the maximal independence polynomial, independence number, the number of independent sets, and enumeration of the MIS configurations of a general graph $G$ by designing tensor element types as commutative semirings while keeping the tensor network generic~\cite{Stepanov2014}.
Table~\ref{tbl:generictypes} summarizes the problems that can be solved by various tensor element types.

\section{Independence polynomial and maximal independence polynomial}
\subsection{Independence polynomial}\label{sec:indpoly}
The independence polynomial is an important graph polynomial that contains the counting information of independent sets. It is defined as
\begin{equation}
I(G, x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\alpha(G)} a_k x^k,
\end{equation}
where $a_k$ is the number of independent sets of size $k$ in $G$, and $\alpha(G)$ is the independence number. The total number of independent sets is thus equal to $I(G, 1)$.
The problem of computing the independence polynomial belongs to the complexity class \#P-hard. One approach to exactly compute the independence polynomial requires a computational time of $O(1.442^{|V|})$~\cite{Ferrin2014}
\blue{I am not sure about this complexity, this is based on the naive analysis of theorem 2.2 in ~\cite{Ferrin2014}}. There are some interesting works on efficiently approximating the independence polynomial~\cite{Harvey2018}, but in this work, we focus on exact methods to compute the independence polynomial.

The independence polynomial is closely related to the matching polynomial, the clique polynomial, and the vertex cover polynomial.
In fact, the independence polynomial can be viewed as a generalization of the matching polynomial, since the matching polynomial of a graph $G$ is the same as the independence polynomial of the line graph of $G$~\cite{Levit2005}.
Thus, our algorithm to compute the independence polynomial can also be used to compute the above graph polynomials. Some properties of the independence polynomial, such as the uni-modality, log-concavity, and roots of the polynomial, are well studied in the literature for special classes of graphs~\cite{Levit2005}.
We hope our algorithms to calculate the independence polynomial can also help further research in these directions. \red{possibly add set packing problem relationship} \blue{I added a subsection in \App{app:otherproblems}?}

To compute the independence polynomial of a graph $G$, we encode it to a tensor network. On the vertex $i$ of the graph $G$, we place a rank-one vertex tensor, $W(x_i)$, of size $2$ parametrized by $x_{i}$ and a rank-two edge tensor, $B$, of size $2 \times 2$ on an edge
\red{I removed the indices $s_{i}$ etc, on the right of the equations, since that looks confusing to me. If I understand correctly, $s_{i}, s_{j}$ just denotes the index of the vector/matrix.}
\blue{To be consistent, we should also remove the index on the LHS. It is better not removing the label information.}
\blue{now?}
\begin{equation}
    W(x_i) = \left(\begin{matrix}
        1 \\
        x_i
    \end{matrix}\right),
    \qquad \quad 
       B = \left(\begin{matrix}
        1  & 1\\
        1 & 0
    \end{matrix}\right), \label{eq:tensor}
\end{equation}
The corresponding tensor network contraction gives
\begin{equation}
    P(G, \{x_1, x_{2}, \ldots,x_{|V|}\}) = \sum\limits_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{|V|} = 0}^{1} \prod\limits_{i=1}^{|V|} W(x_i)_{s_i} \prod\limits_{(i,j) \in E(G)} B_{s_i s_j},
\end{equation}
where the summation runs over all vertex configurations $\{s_1, s_{2}, \ldots,s_{|V|}\}$ and accumulates the product of tensor elements to the output $P$ (see Example \ref{eg:tensorcontraction} for a concrete example).
The tensor index $s_i$ is a boolean variable; $s_{i} = 1$ corresponds that the vertex $i$ is in the independent set, and $s_{i} = 0$ means otherwise. Let us assume the tensor elements are real numbers for now.
The edge tensor element $B_{s_{i}=1, s_{j}=1} = 0$ encodes the independent set constraint, meaning vertex $i$ and $j$ cannot be both in the independent set if they are connected by an edge $(i,j)$. The contraction of the tensor network representing $G$ gives
In the special case of $x_i = x$, the contraction result directly corresponds to the independence polynomial.
The connection can be understood as follows: the product over vertex tensor elements produces a factor $x^k$, where $k=\sum_i s_i$ counts the set size,
and the product over edge tensor elements gives a factor $1$ for a configuration being in an independent set and $0$ otherwise. In the implementation of the algorithm, we benefit from recent advances in tensor network contraction,
where researchers working on quantum circuit simulation evaluate the tensor network by pairwise contracting tensors in a good heuristic order~\cite{Gray2021, Pan2021}.
A good contraction order can reduce the time complexity significantly, at the cost of having a space overhead of $O(2^{\text{tw}(G)})$~\cite{Markov2008}.
The pairwise tensor contraction also makes it possible to utilize basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) functions to speed up the computation for certain tensor element types.

\begin{example}\label{eg:tensorcontraction}
Mapping a graph (left) to a tensor network (right) that encodes the independence polynomial.
In the generalized tensor network's graphical representation, a vertex is mapped to a hyperedge.
We attach a vertex tensor on each hyperedge and an edge tensor between two hyperedges if vertices of the two hyperedges are connected in the original graph.

    \end{align*}
\end{example}

Before contracting the tensor network and evaluating the independence polynomial numerically, let us first elevate the tensor elements $0$s and $1$s in tensors $W(x)$ and $B$ from integers and floating point numbers to the additive identity,
$\mymathbb{0}$, and multiplicative identity, $\mymathbb{1}$, of a commutative semiring as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:generic}.
The most natural approach is to treat the tensor elements as polynomials and evaluate the polynomial directly.
Let us create a polynomial type, and represent a polynomial $a_0 + a_1 x + \ldots + a_k x^k$ as a coefficient vector $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k) \in \mathbb{R}^k$, so, e.g., $x$ is represented as $(0, 1)$.
We define the algebra between the polynomials $a$ of order $k_a$ and $b$ of order $k_b$ as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    a \oplus b &= (a_0 + b_0, a_1 + b_1, \ldots, a_{\max(k_a, k_b)} + b_{\max(k_a, k_b)}),\\
    a \odot b &= (a_0 + b_0, a_1b_0 + a_0b_1, a_{2}b_{0} + a_{1}b_{1} + a_{0}b_{2},  \ldots, a_{k_a} b_{k_b}),\\
    \mymathbb{0} &= (),  \\
    \mymathbb{1} &= (1).\label{eq:polynomial}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
We can see these operations are standard addition and multiplication operations of polynomials, and the polynomial type forms a commutative ring. The tensors $W$ and $B$ can thus be written as 
\begin{equation}
    W^{\rm poly} = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1} \\
        (0,1)
    \end{matrix}\right),   
    \qquad \qquad
        B^{\rm poly} = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1}  & \mymathbb{1} \\
        \mymathbb{1} & \mymathbb{0}
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
By contracting the tensor network with the polynomial type, the final result is the exact representation of the independence polynomial.
One way to efficiently evaluate the multiplication operation is to use the convolution theorem~\cite{Schonhage1971}, but this approach suffers from a space overhead proportional to $\alpha(G)$ because each polynomial requires a vector of such size to store the coefficients. 

Here, we propose to find the independence polynomial by fitting $\alpha(G)+1$ random values of $x_{i}$ and $y_{i} = I(G,x_{i})$. One can then compute the independence polynomial coefficients $a_{i}$ by solving the linear equation: 
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{matrix}
1 & x_0 & x_0^2 & \ldots & x_0^{\alpha(G)} \\
1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \ldots & x_1^{\alpha(G)} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{\alpha(G)} & x_{\alpha(G)}^2 & \ldots & x_{\alpha(G)}^{\alpha(G)}
\end{matrix}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
a_0 \\ a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_{\alpha(G)}
\end{matrix}\right)
= \left(\begin{matrix}
y_0 \\ y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_{\alpha(G)}
\end{matrix}\right).\label{eq:lineareq}
\end{equation}
With this approach, we do not incur the linear overhead in space. However, because the independence polynomial coefficients can have a huge order-of-magnitude range, if we use floating point numbers in the computation, the round-off errors can be significant for the counting of large independent set sizes.
In addition, the number could easily overflow if we use fixed-width integer types.
The big integer type is also not a good option because big integers with varying width can be very slow and is incompatible with graphics processing unit (GPU) devices. These problems can be solved by introducing a finite-field algebra $\text{GF}(p)$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    x ~\oplus~ y &= x+y\pmod p,\\
    x ~\odot~ y &= xy\pmod p,\\
    \mymathbb{0} &= 0,\\
    \mymathbb{1} &= 1.
\end{split}\label{eq:finitefield}
\end{equation}
With a finite-field algebra, we have the following observations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One can use Gaussian elimination~\cite{Golub2013} to solve the linear equation \Eq{eq:lineareq} since it is a generic algorithm that works for any elements with field algebra. The multiplicative inverse of a finite-field algebra can be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm.
    \item Given the remainders of a larger unknown integer $x$ over a set of co-prime integers $\{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}$,
    $x \pmod {p_1 \times p_2 \times \ldots \times p_n}$ can be computed using the Chinese remainder theorem. With this, one can infer big integers from small integers.
\end{enumerate}
With these observations, we develop Algorithm~\ref{alg:finitefield} to compute the independence polynomial exactly without introducing space overheads.
This is an iterative algorithm that tries different prime numbers $p$ until convergence.
In each iteration, we contract tensor networks to evaluate the polynomial for each $x\in X$ on the finite field algebra ${\rm GF}(p)$.
Let use denote the results as $Y$, then we solve a linear equation $Y = X A_p$ using the gaussian elimination on ${\rm GF}(p)$ to find the coefficient moduluses $A_p \equiv A \pmod p$.
Finally we apply the Chinese remainder theorem to get $A \pmod {P\times p}$, where $P$ is a product of all prime numbers chosen in previous iterations.
If this number does not change comparing with the previous iteration, it indicates a convergent result.
All computations are done with integers of fixed width $W$ except the last step of applying Chinese remainder theorem.
In \App{app:fft}, we provide another method to solve the linear equation using discrete Fourier transform.

\subsection{Maximal independence polynomial}
Sometimes people are interested in knowing maximal solutions to understand why their programs are trapped in a local minimal.
In this paper, the word ``maximal'' is different with the ``maximum'' discussed the previous discussion in such a way that it is not necessarily refer to the gloal optimum.
Instead of counting all independent sets, the maximal independence polynomial counts the number of maximal independent sets of various sizes~\cite{Hu2017}.
 Concretely, it is defined as
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm max}(G, x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\alpha(G)} b_k x^k,
\end{equation}
where $b_k$ is the number of maximal independent sets of size $k$ in $G$.
Obviously, $b_{k} \leq a_{k}$ and $b_{\alpha(G)} = a_{\alpha(G)}$. $I_{\rm max}(G, 1)$ counts the total number of maximal independent sets~\cite{Gaspers2012, Manne2013}, where the fastest algorithm currently has a runtime of $O(1.3642^{|V|})$~\cite{Gaspers2012}.
For the problem of finding the MIS, $b_{k}$ counts the number of local optimum at size $k < \alpha(G)$, and can, in some cases, provide hints on the difficulty of finding the MIS using local algorithms~\red{cite experiment}.
The uni-modality, log-concavity, and real-rootness properties of the maximal independence polynomial for special classes of graphs have also been studied~\cite{Hu2017}. 

Let us denote the neighborhood of a vertex $v$ as $N(v)$ and denote $N[v] = N(v)\cup \{v\}$.
A maximal independent set $I_m$ is an independent set where there exists no vertex $v$ such that $I_m \cap N[v]  = \emptyset$.
We can modify the tensor network for computing the independence polynomial to include this restriction. Instead of defining the restriction on vertices and edges, it is more natural to define it on $N[v]$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:maximal}
    T(x_v)_{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_{|N(v)|},s_v} = \begin{cases}
        s_vx_v & s_1=s_2=\ldots=s_{|N(v)|}=0,\\
        1-s_v& otherwise.\\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Intuitively, it means if all the neighborhood vertices are not in $I_{m}$, i.e., $ s_1=s_2=\ldots=s_{|N(v)|}=0$, then $v$ should be in $I_{m}$, counted as $x_{v}$,
and if any of the neighborhood vertices is in $I_{m}$, i.e., $\exists i \in \{1,2,\ldots, |N(v)|\}$ s.t. $s_{i} = 1$, then $v$ cannot be in $I_{m}$.
As an example, for a vertex of degree 2, the resulting rank-3 tensor is
\begin{equation}
    T(x_v)=\left(\begin{matrix}
    \left(\begin{matrix}
        0 &1 \\
        1 &1
    \end{matrix}\right)\\
    \left(\begin{matrix}
        x_v &0 \\
        0 &0
    \end{matrix}\right)
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
 
With the tensors defined as $T(x_v)$, we can perform a similar computation of contracting the tensor network with the same tensor element types as described in the previous section~\ref{sec:indpoly}, the result of which then produces the maximal independence polynomial.

One can see the average degree of a tensor is increase.
The computational complexity of this new tensor network contraction is often greater than the one for computing the independence polynomial.
However, in most sparse graphs, this tensor network contraction approach is still significantly faster than enumerating all the maximal cliques on its complement graph using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm~\cite{Bron1973}, which is the standard algorithm that we are aware of to compute the maximal independence polynomial.
Let us consider the example in~\Sec{eg:tensorcontraction}, its corresponding tensor network structure for computing maximal independent sets now becomes:

\section{Maximum independent sets and its counting problem}
\subsection{Tropical algebra for finding the independence number and counting MISs}
In the previous section, we focused on computing the independence polynomial for a graph $G$ of given independence number $\alpha(G)$, but we did not show how to compute this number.
The method we use to compute this quantity is based on the following observations. Let $x=\infty$, the independence polynomial becomes
\begin{equation}
I(G, \infty) = a_{\alpha(G)} \infty^{\alpha(G)},
\end{equation}
where the lower-order terms vanish. We can thus replace the polynomial type $a = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k)$ with $a(k) = (a_{k}, k)$, where the second element stores the largest exponent $k$ and the first element stores the corresponding coefficient $a_{k}$.
From this, we can define a new algebra as \red{I've changed this, but I don't have strong feelings about this. We can certainly consider changing back.
I thought this would be more consistent with the earlier notations and show how it's stored in the program as well.}
\blue{I prefer the previous one, what about you @XG?}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    a(k) \oplus a(j) &= \begin{cases}
        \left(a_k + a_j, \max(k,j) \right), & k = j \\
        \left(a_j, \max(k,j) \right), & k < j \\
        \left(a_k, \max(k,j) \right), & k > j
    \end{cases}, \\
    a(k) \odot a(j) &= (a_k a_j, k+j) \\
    \mymathbb{0} &= (0, -\infty)\\
    \mymathbb{1} &= (1, 0). \label{eq:countingtropical}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%    a_x\infty^x \oplus a_y\infty^y &= \begin{cases}
%        (a_x + a_y)\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x = y\\
%        a_y\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x < y\\
%        a_x\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x > y
%    \end{cases}, \\
%    a_x\infty^x \odot a_y\infty^y &= a_x a_y\infty^{x+y}\\
%    \mymathbb{0} &= 0\infty^{-\infty}\\
%    \mymathbb{1} &= 1\infty^{0}. \label{eq:countingtropical}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
% In the program, we only need to store the exponent $x$ and the corresponding coefficient $a_x$ initialized to $1$. 
The algebra of the exponents becomes the max-plus tropical algebra: $k \oplus j = \max(k,j)$ and $k \odot j = k + j$~\cite{Maclagan2015, Moore2011}.
This algebra is the same as the one used in Liu et al.~\cite{Liu2021} to calculate and count spin glass ground states.
For independent set calculations here, the vertex tensor and edge tensor becomes:
\begin{equation}
    W^{\rm tropical} = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1} \\
        (1,1)
    \end{matrix}\right),   
    \qquad \qquad
        B^{\rm tropical} = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1}  & \mymathbb{1} \\
        \mymathbb{1} & \mymathbb{0}
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Truncated polynomial algebra for counting independent sets of large size}
Instead of counting just the MISs, one may be interested in counting the independent sets of large sizes close to the MIS size.
For example, if one is interested in counting only $a_{\alpha(G)}$ and $a_{\alpha(G)-1}$, we can define a truncated polynomial algebra by keeping only the largest two coefficients in the polynomial in \Eq{eq:polynomial}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    a \oplus b &= (a_{\max(k_a, k_b)-1} + b_{\max(k_a, k_b)-1}, a_{\max(k_a, k_b)} + b_{\max(k_a, k_b)}),\\
    a \odot b &= (a_{k_a-1} b_{k_b}+a_{k_a} b_{k_b-1}, a_{k_a} b_{k_b}),\\
    \mymathbb{0} &= (), \\
    \mymathbb{1} &= (1).\label{eq:max2poly}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
In the program, we thus need a data structure that contains three fields, the largest order $k$, and the coefficients for the two largest orders $a_k$ and $a_{k-1}$.
This approach can clearly be extended to calculate more independence polynomial coefficients and is more efficient than calculating the entire independence polynomial.
As will be shown bellow, this algebra can also be extended to enumerate suboptimal solutions.

\section{Enumeration of configurations and enumeration bounds}
\subsection{Enumeration of MIS configurations}
The enumeration problems of independent sets are also interesting and has been studied extensively in the literature~\cite{Bron1973, Eppstein2010, Johnson1988}, including,
for example, the enumeration of all independent sets, the enumeration of all maximal independent sets, or the enumeration of all MISs.
The standard algorithm to enumerate all maximal independent sets is the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm~\cite{Bron1973}, which, of course, includes the enumeration of all MISs and can be used to enumerate all independent sets as well.
Here, we adapt the tensor element types for different enumeration problems.
For example, our tensor-network based algorithm to enumerate all MISs is expectedly much faster and more space-efficient than the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, which lists all maximal independent sets. 

To enumerate all independent sets, we input a set of configurations into the tensor elements. More concretely, we design a new element type having the following algebra
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    s \oplus t &= s \cup t\\
    s \odot t &= \{\sigma \lor^\circ \tau \, | \, \sigma \in s, \tau \in t\}\\
    \mymathbb{0} &= \{\}\\
    \mymathbb{1} &= \{0^{\otimes |V|}\}.
\end{split}\label{eq:set}
\end{equation}
where $s$ and $t$ are each a set of $|V|$-bit strings and $\lor^\circ$ is the bitwise OR operation over two bit strings.
\begin{example}\label{eg:setalgebra}
    For elements being bit vectors of length $5$, we have the following set algebra
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    &\{00001\} \oplus \{01110, 01000\} = \{01110, 01000\} \oplus \{00001\} = \{00001,01110, 01000\}\\
    &\{00001\} \oplus \{\} = \{\}\\
&\\
    &\{00001\} \odot \{01110, 01000\} = \{01110, 01000\} \odot \{00001\} = \{01111, 01001\}\\
    &\{00001\} \odot \{\} = \{\}\\
    &\{00001\} \odot \{00000\} = \{00001\}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{example}

The variable $x_{i}$ in the vertex tensor is initialized to $x_i = \{\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\}$, where $\boldsymbol{e}_i$ is the standard basis vector of size $|V|$ and having 1 at index $i$. The vertex and edge tensors are thus
\begin{equation}
    W^{\rm enum}(\{\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\}) = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1} \\
        \{\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\}
    \end{matrix}\right),   
    \qquad \qquad
        B^{\rm enum} = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1}  & \mymathbb{1} \\
        \mymathbb{1} & \mymathbb{0}
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}

This sets algebra can serve as the coefficients in \Eq{eq:countingtropical} to enumerate all MISs, \Eq{eq:polynomial} to enumerate independent sets of different sizes,
or \Eq{eq:max2poly} to enumerate all independent sets of size $\alpha(G)$ and $\alpha(G)-1$.
For example, to enumerate only the MISs, with the tropical algebra, we define $s(k) = (s_{k}, k)$, where the first element follows the algebra in \Eq{eq:set} and the second element follows the max-plus tropical algebra.
The combined operations become: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    s(k) \oplus s(j) &= \begin{cases}
        \left(s_k \cup s_j, \max(k,j) \right), & k = j \\
        \left(s_j, \max(k,j) \right), & k < j \\
        \left(s_k, \max(k,j) \right), & k > j
    \end{cases}, \\
    s(k) \odot s(j) &= (\{\sigma \lor^\circ \tau \, | \, \sigma \in s_k, \tau \in s_j\}, k+j) \\
    \mymathbb{0} &= (\{ \}, -\infty)\\
    \mymathbb{1} &= (\{0^{\otimes |V|}\}, 0). \label{eq:countingtropicalset}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%    s_x\infty^x \oplus s_y\infty^y &= \begin{cases}
%        (s_x \cup s_y)\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x = y\\
%        s_y\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x < y\\
%        s_x\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x > y
%    \end{cases},\\
%    s_x\infty^x \odot s_y\infty^y &= \{\sigma \lor^\circ \tau | \sigma \in s_x, \tau \in s_y\}\infty^{x+y},\\
%    \mymathbb{0} &= \{\}\infty^{-\infty},\\
%    \mymathbb{1} &= \{0^{\otimes |V|}\}\infty^{0},
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
Clearly, the vertex tensor and edge tensor become
\begin{equation}
    W^{\rm MISenum}(\{\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\}) = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1} \\
        \left({\{\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\}, 1} \right)
    \end{matrix}\right),   
    \qquad \qquad
        B^{\rm MISenum} = \left(\begin{matrix}
        \mymathbb{1}  & \mymathbb{1} \\
        \mymathbb{1} & \mymathbb{0}
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
The contraction of the corresponding tensor network yields an enumeration of all MIS configurations.

If one is interested in obtaining only a single MIS configuration, one can just keep a single configuration in the intermediate computations to save the computational effort.
Here is a new algebra defined on the bit strings, replacing the sets of bit strings in \Eq{eq:set}, 
%We leave this as an exercise for readers.
%
%\iffalse
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%    \sigma_x\infty^x \oplus \sigma_y\infty^y &= \begin{cases}
%        {\rm select}(\sigma_x, \sigma_y)\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x = y\\
%        \sigma_y\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x < y\\
%        \sigma_x\infty^{\max(x,y)}, & x > y
%    \end{cases},\\
%    \sigma_x\infty^x \odot \sigma_y\infty^y &= (\sigma_x \lor^\circ \sigma_y)\infty^{x+y},\\
%    \mymathbb{0} &= 1^{\otimes n}\infty^{-\infty},\\
%    \mymathbb{1} &= 0^{\otimes n}\infty^{0},
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%\fi
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \sigma \oplus \tau &= {\rm select}(\sigma, \tau), \\
    \sigma \odot \tau &= (\sigma\lor^\circ \tau),\\
    \mymathbb{0} &= 1^{\otimes |V|}, \\
    \mymathbb{1} &= 0^{\otimes |V|},
\end{split}\label{eq:singleconfig}
\end{equation}
where the \texttt{select} function picks one of $\sigma$ and $\tau$ by some criteria to make the algebra commutative and associative, e.g. by picking one with a smaller integer value.
%In practice, we can just pick randomly from them, in which case the program will output one of the MIS configurations randomly.
\red{Can we also enumerate all maximal independent sets by combining with \Eq{eq:maximal} or enumerate suboptimal solutions by combining with the truncated polynomial?}
\blue{now?}

Although the above discussion is in the context of the the MIS problem, we can also combine the above algebras with the maximal independence network in \Eq{eq:maximal} to enumerate or sample maximal independent sets,
as well as other problems in \App{app:otherproblems} for configuration enumeration and sampling.

\subsection{Bounding the MIS enumeration space}
When we use the algebra in \Eq{eq:countingtropicalset} to enumerate all MIS configurations, we find that the program stores significantly more intermediate configurations than necessary and thus incur significant overheads in space.
To speed up the computation and reduce space overhead, we use $\alpha(G)$ to bound the searching space.
First, we compute the value of $\alpha(G)$ with tropical algebra and cache all intermediate tensors.
Then, we compute a boolean mask for each cached tensor, where we use a boolean true to represent a tensor element having a contribution to the MIS (i.e.\ with a non-zero gradient) and boolean false otherwise.
Finally, we perform masked matrix multiplication using the new element type with the above algebra, \Eq{eq:countingtropicalset}, for obtaining all configurations.
Note that these masks in fact correspond to tensor elements with non-zero gradients with respect to the MIS size; we compute these masks by back propagation of the gradients.
To derive the back-propagation rule for tensor contraction,
we first reduce the problem to finding the back-propagation rule of a tropical matrix multiplication $C = A B$.
Since $ C_{ik} = \bigoplus_{j} \ A_{ij} \odot B_{jk} = \max_{j} \ A_{ij} \odot B_{jk}$ with tropical algebra, we have the following inequality
\begin{equation}
    A_{ij} \odot B_{jk} \leq C_{ik}.
\end{equation}
Here $\leq$ on tropical numbers are the same as the real-number algebra.
The equality holds for some $j'$, which means $A_{ij'}$ and $B_{j'k}$ have contributions to $C_{ik}$.
Since $A_{ij} \odot B_{jk} = A_{ij} + B_{jk}$, one can move $B_{jk}$ to the right hand side of the inequality: 
\begin{equation}
    A_{ij} \leq C_{ik} \odot B_{jk}^{\circ -1}
\end{equation}
where ${}^{\circ -1}$ is the element-wise multiplicative inverse on tropical algebra (which is the additive inverse on real numbers).
The inequality still holds if we take the minimum over $k$: 
\begin{equation}
    A_{ij} \leq \min_{k}(C_{ik} \odot B_{jk}^{\circ -1}) = \left(\max_{k} \left(C_{ik}^{\circ -1} \odot B_{jk} \right) \right)^{\circ -1} = \left(\bigoplus_{k} \left(C_{ik}^{\circ -1} \odot B_{jk} \right) \right)^{\circ -1} = \left( C^{\circ-1} B^{\mathsf{T}} \right)^{\circ -1}_{ij}.
\end{equation}
On the right hand side, we transform the operation into a tropical matrix multiplication so that we can utilize the fast tropical BLAS routines~\cite{TropicalGEMM}.
Again, the equality holds if and only if the element $A_{ij}$ has a contribution to $C$ (i.e.\ having a non-zero gradient).
Let the gradient mask for $C$ being $\overline C$, the back-propagation rule for gradient masks reads
\begin{equation}
\overline{A}_{ij} = \delta \left(A_{ij}, \left( \left( C^{\circ-1} \circ \overline C \right) B^{\mathsf{T}} \right)_{ij}^{\circ -1} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\circ$ is the element-wise product, boolean false is treated as the tropical number $\mymathbb{0}$, and boolean true is treated as the tropical number $\mymathbb{1}$.
This rule defined on matrix multiplication can be easily generalized to tensor contraction by replacing the matrix multiplication between $C^{\circ-1} \circ \overline C$ and $B^{\mathsf{T}}$ by a tensor contraction.
With the above method, one can significantly reduce the space needed to store the intermediate configurations.

\section{Benchmarks and case studies}
\subsection{Performance benchmarks}
We run a single thread benchmark on CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2686 v4 @ 2.30GHz,
and its CUDA version on a GPU Tesla V100.
The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:benchmark}.
The graph we use are random 3 regular graphs, a typical type of sparse graph that having small tree width $\text{tw}(G) \leq |V|/6$~\cite{Fomin2006}.


\begin{figure} 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, trim={0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm}, clip]{figures/fig1.pdf}
    \caption{Benchmark results for computing different properties of independent sets on a random three regular graph with different tensor element types.
    (b) is the computing time for computing maximum independent set size, number of independent sets and suboptimal sets.
    (c) is the computing time for independence polynomials with different approaches.
    (d) is the computing time for finding all configurations and a single configuration, with or without bounding.
    }
    \label{fig:benchmark}
\end{figure}

Among the benchmarks shown in \Fig{fig:benchmark}, computing \texttt{max size (CPU)},
\texttt{total size (CPU)}, \texttt{total size (GPU)}, \texttt{IDP (FFT) (CPU)}, \texttt{IDP (FFT) (GPU)} and \texttt{single configuration (bounding) (CPU)} can utilize fast BLAS functions,
hence they are relatively faster comparing to other methods in the same category.
Only algebras requiring dynamic sized structures can not be computed on GPU, here are polynomial algebra for computing independence polynomial and set algebra for enumerating configurations.
When computing the independence polynomial, the finite field approach is the only method without round off error that can run on GPU.
To enumerate the MISs, the technique to bound the enumeration space is important,
without which the largest enumeratible size is only $150$ with 32G memory while being one order slower.

\subsection{Example case studies} In this section, we give a few examples where the different properties of independence sets are used.
In all the examples, the types of graphs we used are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lattices}, where vertices are all placed on square lattices with lattice dimensions $L \times L$.
The graphs include: the square grid graphs, denoted as SG; the square grid graphs with a filling factor $p$, denoted as SG$(p)$, where $\lfloor pL^{2} \rfloor$ square grids are occupied with vertices;
the King's graphs, denoted as K; the King's graphs with a filling factor $p$, denoted as K$(p)$. 

\begin{figure}[t] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, trim={0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm}, clip]{lattices.pdf}
    \caption{The types of graphs used in the benchmark and case studies.
    The lattice dimensions are $L\times L$. (a) Square grid graph denoted as SG. (b) Square grid graph with a filling factor $p=0.8$, denoted as SG(0.8).
    (c) King's graph denoted as K. (d) King's graph with a filling factor $p=0.8$, denoted as K(0.8).}
    \label{fig:lattices}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Number of independent sets and hard-square entropy constant}
The number of independent sets for square grid graphs of size $L \times L$ form a well-known integer sequence (\href{https://oeis.org/A006506}{OEIS A006506}), which is thought as a two-dimensional generalization of the Fibonacci numbers.

\subsubsection{Partition functions and finite-temperature phase transitions}



\section{Discussion and conclusion}
We have introduced a new approach based on tensor network contraction to compute the independence number, independence polynomial, maximal independence polynomial, and enumeration of MIS configurations.
We derived the backward rule for tropical tensor network to bound the search of solution space.
Although many of these properties are global, we can encode them to different tensor element types as commutative semirings.
The power of our tensor network approach is not only limited to the independent set problem, in \App{app:otherproblems}, we show how to map the matching problem and $k$-coloring problem to a tensor network.
Here, we want to discuss more from the programming perspective.
We show some of the Julia language~\cite{Bezanson2012} implementations in Appendix~\ref{sec:technical} and you will find it surprisingly short.
What we need to do is just defining two operations $\oplus$ and $\odot$ and two special elements $\mymathbb{0}$ and $\mymathbb{1}$.
The style that we program is called generic programming,
meaning one can feed different data types into the same program, and the program will compute the result with a proper performance.
In C++, one can use templates for such a purpose.
We chose Julia because its just-in-time compiling is very powerful that it can generate fast code dynamically for users.
Elements of fixed size, such as the finite-field algebra, truncated polynomial, tropical number and tropical number with counting or configuration field described in this paper can all be inlined in an array.
Furthermore, these inlined arrays can be uploaded to GPU devices for faster computation with generic matrix multiplication implemented in CUDA.jl~\cite{Besard2018}.

\end{description}

One can install these packages by opening a Julia REPL, type \colorbox{lightgray}{\texttt{]}} to enter the \texttt{pkg>} mode and type, e.g.
\begin{lstlisting}
pkg> add OMEinsum LightGraphs Mods Primes FFTW Polynomials TropicalNumbers
\end{lstlisting}

It may surprise you that the Julia implementation of algorithms introduced in the paper is so short that except the bounding and sparsity related parts,
all are contained in this appendix. After installing required packages, one can open a Julia REPL and copy the following code into it.

\lstinputlisting[breaklines]{../democode/demo.jl}

In the above examples, the configuration enumeration is very slow, one should use the optimal MIS size for bounding as described in the main text.
We will not show any example about implementing the backward rule here because it has approximately 100 lines of code.

    \draw [decorate] (2.7, 0.5) -- (2.7, 5.5);
\end{tikzpicture}}
where we use different colors to distinguish different hyperedges.
Now, the vertex tensor is always rank $1$.
With the same naive contraction order, we can see the maximum intermediate tensor is approximately of size $2^L$ by counting the colors.

\section{Generalizing to other graph problems}\label{app:otherproblems}
There are some other graph problems that can be encoded in a tensor network.
To understand its representation power, it is a good starting point to connect it with dynamic programming because
a tensor network can be viewed as a special type of dynamic programming where its update rule can be characterized by a linear operation.
Courcelle’s theorem~\cite{Courcelle1990,Barr2020} states that a problem quantified by monadic second order logic (MSO) on a graph with bounded treewidth $k$ can be solved in linear time with respect to the graph size.
Dynamic programming is a traditional approach to attack a MSO problem, it can solve the maximum independent set problem in $O(2^k)n$, which is similar to the tensor network approach.
We mentioned in the main text that tensor network has nice analytic property make it easier for generic programming.
The cost is, the tensor network is less expressive than dynamic programming,
%\iffalse
%The cost is, it is less expressive than MSO because the tensor network described by \Eq{eq:tensor} can be expressed in MSO as
%\begin{align}
%    \begin{split}
%    \exists_X\forall_{u}&(\\
%    &\quad\forall_{v} 
%    \neg {\rm adj}(u, v) \lor
%    ({\rm adj}(u, v) \land ( \hspace{5em}\text{$\triangleright$ restrictions on edges}\\
%    &\quad\quad(u \not\in X \land v \not\in X \land B_{00}) \lor\\
%    &\quad\quad(u \not\in X \land v \in X \land B_{01}) \lor\\
%    &\quad\quad(u \in X \land v \not\in X \land B_{10}) \lor\\
%    &\quad\quad(u \in X \land v \in X \land B_{11})\\
%    &\quad)\\
%    &))\land\\
%    &(\hspace{16.5em}\text{$\triangleright$ restrictions on vertices}\\
%    &\quad(u \not\in X \land W_{0}) \lor\\
%    &\quad(u \in X \land W_{1})\\
%    &),
%    \end{split}
%\end{align}
%while not all monadic second order logic can be represented as a tensor network contraction,
%for example, it is hard to construct a tensor network to decide whether a graph is connected or not.
%At the cost of losing expressiveness, we can encode the properties of the graph into the tensor elements.
%\fi
However, that are still some other problems that can be expressed in the framework of generic tensor network.
\subsection{Matching problem}
A matching polynomial of a graph $G$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    M(G, x) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{|V|/2} c_k x^k,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the number of matches, and coefficients $c_k$ are the corresponding counting.

We define a tensor of rank $d(v) = |N(v)|$ on vertex $v$ such that,
\begin{equation}
    W_{v\rightarrow n_1, v\rightarrow n_2, \ldots, v\rightarrow n_{d(v)}} = \begin{cases}
        1, & \sum_{i=1}^{d(v)} v\rightarrow n_i \leq 1,\\
        0, & \text{otherwise},
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and a tensor of rank $1$ on the bond
\begin{equation}
    B_{v\rightarrow w} = \begin{cases}
    1, & v \rightarrow w = 0 \\
    x, & v \rightarrow w = 1.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here, we use bond index $v \rightarrow w$ to label tensors.

\subsection{k-Coloring}
Let us use 3-coloring on the vertex as an example. We can define a vertex tensor as
\begin{equation}
    W = \left(\begin{matrix}
        r_v\\
        g_v\\
        b_v
    \end{matrix}\right),
\end{equation}
and an edge tensor as
\begin{equation}
    B = \left(\begin{matrix}
        0 & 1 & 1\\
        1 & 0 & 1\\
        1 & 1 & 0
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
The number of possible coloring can be obtained by contracting this tensor network by setting vertex tensor elements $r_v, g_v$ and $b_v$ to $1$.
By designing generic types as tensor elements, one should be able to get all possible colorings.
It is straight forward to define the k-coloring problem on edges hence we will not discuss the detailed construction here.

\subsection{Max cut problem}
Max cut problem is also known as the boolean spinglass problem.
Its tensor network representation does not contain vertex tensors.
The edge tensor can be defined as
\begin{equation}
    B(x_{ij}) = \left(\begin{matrix}
        1 & x_{ij}\\
        x_{ij} & 1
    \end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}
We can also define a polynomial about edges variables by setting $x_{ij} = x$,
its $k$th coefficient is two times the number of configurations of cut size $k$.

\subsection{Set packing}
Set packing the the hypergraph version of the maximum independent set problem, where each set corresponds to a vertex, each element corresponds to a hyperedge.
To solve the set packing problem, we just remove the rank 2 restriction of an edge tensor
\begin{equation}
    B_{v,w,\ldots, z} = \begin{cases}
        1, & v+w+\ldots+z\leq 1,\\
        0, & otherwise
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Discrete Fourier transform for computing the independence polynomial}\label{app:fft}

In section~\ref{sec:indpoly}, we show that the independence polynomial can be obtained by solving the linear equation \Eq{eq:lineareq}. Since the coefficients of the independence polynomial can range many orders of magnitude, the round-off errors in fitting can be significant if we use random floating point numbers for $x_{i}$.
In the main text, we propose to use a finite field $\text{GF}(p)$ to circumvent overflow and round-off errors. Here, we give another method based on discrete Fourier transform.
Instead of choosing $x_{i}$ as random numbers, we can choose them such that they form a geometric sequence in the complex domain $x_j = r\omega^j$, where $r \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\omega = e^{-2\pi i/( \alpha(G)+1)}$. The linear equation thus becomes
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{matrix}
1 & r & r^2 & \ldots & r^{\alpha(G)} \\
1 & r\omega & r^2\omega^2 & \ldots & r^{\alpha(G)} \omega^{\alpha(G)} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\ddots & \vdots \\
1 & r\omega^{\alpha(G)} & r^2\omega^{2{\alpha(G)}} & \ldots & r^{\alpha(G)}\omega^{{\alpha(G)}^2}
\end{matrix}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
a_0 \\ a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_{\alpha(G)}
\end{matrix}\right)
= \left(\begin{matrix}
y_0 \\ y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_{\alpha(G)}
\end{matrix}\right).
\end{equation}

Let us rearrange the coefficients $r^j$ to $a_j$, the matrix on the left side becomes the discrete Fourier transform matrix. Thus, we can obtain the coefficients by inverse Fourier transform $\vec a_r = {\rm FFT^{-1}}(\omega) \cdot \vec y$, where $(\vec a_r)_j = a_j r ^j$.
By choosing different $r$, one can obtain better precision in low independent set size region  ($r<1$) or high independent set size region ($r>1$).
