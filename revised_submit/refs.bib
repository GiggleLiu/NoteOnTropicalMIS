    abstract = { Understanding NP-complete problems is a central topic in computer science (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time). This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer’s Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima. }

abstract = {The maximum clique problem (MCP) is to determine in a graph a clique (i.e., a complete subgraph) of maximum cardinality. The MCP is notable for its capability of modeling other combinatorial problems and real-world applications. As one of the most studied NP-hard problems, many algorithms are available in the literature and new methods are continually being proposed. Given that the two existing surveys on the MCP date back to 1994 and 1999 respectively, one primary goal of this paper is to provide an updated and comprehensive review on both exact and heuristic MCP algorithms, with a special focus on recent developments. To be informative, we identify the general framework followed by these algorithms and pinpoint the key ingredients that make them successful. By classifying the main search strategies and putting forward the critical elements of the most relevant clique methods, this review intends to encourage future development of more powerful methods and motivate new applications of the clique approaches.}

title = {Maximum Independent Set and Related Problems, with Applications},

publisher = {University of Florida},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This dissertation develops novel approaches to solving computationally difficult combinatorial
optimization problems on graphs, namely maximum independent set, maximum clique, graph
coloring, minimum dominating sets and related problems. The application areas of the
considered problems include information retrieval, classification theory, economics,
scheduling, experimental design, and computer vision among many others. The maximum
independent set and related problems are formulated as nonlinear programs, and new
methods for finding good quality approximate solutions in reasonable computational
times are introduced. All algorithms are implemented and successfully tested on a
number of examples from diverse application areas. The proposed methods favorably
compare with other competing approaches. A large part of this dissertation is devoted
to detailed studies of selected applications of the problems of interest. Novel techniques
for analyzing the structure of financial markets based on their network representation
are proposed and verified using massive data sets generated by the U.S. stock markets.
The network representation of a market is based on cross-correlations of price fluctuations
of the financial instruments, and provides a valuable tool for classifying the instruments.
In another application, new exact values and estimates of size of the largest error
correcting codes are computed using optimization in specially constructed graphs.
Error correcting codes lie in the heart of digital technology, making cell phones,
compact disk players and modems possible. They are also of a special significance
due to increasing importance of reliability issues in Internet transmissions. Finally,
efficient approximate algorithms for construction of virtual backbone in wireless
networks by means of solving the minimum connected dominating set problem in unit-disk
graphs are developed and tested.},

Our major contribution is an exact exponential-time algorithm. This branching algorithm computes the number of distinct maximal independent sets in a graph in time O(1.3642n), where n is the number of vertices of the input graph. We use this counting algorithm and previously known algorithms for various other problems related to independent sets to derive algorithms for problems related to bicliques via polynomial-time reductions.},

	abstract = {We have studied the hard-square lattice gas, using corner transfer matrices. In particular, we have obtained the first 24 terms of the high-density series for the order parameter?2??1. From these we estimate the critical activity to be 3.7962$\pm$0.0001. This is in excellent agreement with the earlier work of Gaunt and Fisher. It conflicts with the value 4.0 given by M{\"u}ller-Hartmann and Zittartz's formula for the critical point of the antiferromagnetic Ising model in a field, so we conclude that this formula, while a good approximation, is not exact.},

abstract = {Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm’s performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins. Realizing quantum speedup for solving practical, computationally hard problems is the central challenge in quantum information science. Ebadi et al. used Rydberg atom arrays composed of up to 289 coupled qubits in two spatial dimensions to investigate quantum optimization algorithms for solving the maximum independent set, a paradigmatic nondeterministic polynomial time–hard combinatorial optimization problem (see the Perspective by Schleier-Smith). A hardware-efficient encoding protocol associated with Rydberg blockade was used to realize a closed-loop optimization method to test several variational algorithms and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of nonplanar graphs with programmable connectivity. The results demonstrate the potential of quantum machines as a tool for the discovery of new promising algorithm classes. —ISO Rydberg atom arrays provide quantum speed-up for solving computationally hard optimization problems.}}

@article{Garey1977,
abstract = { An optimum rectilinear Steiner tree for a set A of points in the plane is a tree which interconnects A using horizontal and vertical lines of shortest possible total length. Such trees correspond to single net wiring patterns on printed backplanes which minimize total wire length. We show that the problem of determining this minimum length, given A, is \$NP\$-complete. Thus the problem of finding optimum rectilinear Steiner trees is probably computationally hopeless, and the emphasis of the literature for this problem on heuristics and special case algorithms is well justified. A number of intermediary lemmas concerning the \$NP\$-completeness of certain graph-theoretic problems are proved and may be of independent interest. },
